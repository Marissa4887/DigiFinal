Instructions:

Running the project
- Download the both Million_working2 and gutenberg py files from github
- Make sure the terminal is open and run the Million_working.py file.
- In the terminal you will find instructions to play the game.

Game rules
- Who Want's to be Millionare game is based on the TV show but there are some differences.
- Instructions will appear on screen and prompt the player to enter  the appropriate information, but listed here as well.
- This game allows the player to make only one mistake to lose it all. So there are no options to phone a friend, etc. It is a win/lose scenario.
- After losing the player is asked if they would like to play again (Y/N). If yes the playing restart at the beginning. If no, the process is exited.

Playing
- To start a player must enter their name.
- The game randomly selects a title with a correct author and 3 other random author names. 
The player must select the correct letter (A, B, C, or D). 
- If correct another question will be selected and the game continues.
- If incorrect the game ends, and tells the  player the level and amount of money lost.
- To win the user must make 15 correct guesses in a row.

NOTES
- I had help from my tutor and the api that was a problem. Searched git hub for solutions and google (i.e. PyPI) but ultimately asked Nada if she had a working solution and she shared it with me. This worked. 
- The game  keeps going after 15 correct answers. I worked on how to get it working for so long that when I tested 15 correct answers in a row, I realized that I had not addressed this ending scenario. So, I plan to work on this part next.
